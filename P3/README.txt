We have two different boot images and sets of files for
these programs as our implementation made them incompatible 
with each other.


Program 1
Files modified for P1: tty.c tty.h termios.h

For this program we modified tty.c, tty.h and termios.h.
While logging in the user can hit control K which makes the os
go into a new state to await the entry of a number. Upon pressing
a number after control K, that many characters will be deleted 
and stored. The user is press to continue entering letters,
and press control Y at any time to re-enter the previously 
deleted characters. Afterwards the user can do this again, 
or backspace, etc.



Program 2
Files modified for P2: main.c alloc.c

For this program we modified main.c and alloc.c to make the os
allocate memory with the worst-fit implementation rather than
first-fit, which it currently uses. In alloc.c, we changed the alloc_mem 
function to change its memory allocation implementation. Unfortunately, 
we were not able to bind the display of holes in main memory to a function  
key and instead we had it print holes from alloc.c, which 
essentially spams the terminal and makes it unusable, but is
suitable for this programâ€™s purposes.
